=========================

På denna sida diskuterar vi allt som har med den fantastiska filmen The Room att göra. Har du inte sett den är det dags nu. Här följer en kort beskrivning:

![The Room](https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYjEzN2FlYmYtNDkwMC00NGFkLWE5ODctYmE5NmYxNzE2MmRiXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMjMwODc5Mw@@._V1_.jpg)

[IMDB](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0368226/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1)  
IMDB-betyg: 3.7

This film centers on Johnny, a man who has it all; great friends, a good job, and a gorgeous fiancée named Lisa. But Lisa's innocent act masks the fact that she's looking to bring Johnny down, and her manipulations are tearing Johnny apart. As Lisa informs her cancer-ridden mother, Claudette, that Johnny hit her (and he did not hit her, that is bullshit, he did not!), Johnny's best friend, Mark, finds his resistance to Lisa's seductive charms weakening. Meanwhile, local orphan Denny looks up to Johnny, and needs the older man's help after the teen rips off a drug dealer. What kind of drugs? It doesn't matter. Then guys play football in tuxedos, because you can play football anywhere. This movie is seriously not to be missed.

###Citat
**Mark**: How was work today?  
**Johnny**: Oh, pretty good. We got a new client and the bank will make a lot of money.  
**Mark**: What client?  
**Johnny**: I cannot tell you; it's confidential.  
**Mark**: Aw, come on. Why not?  
**Johnny**: No, I can't. Anyway, how is your sex life?  


**Johnny**: I kill you, you bastard!  
**Mark**: You couldn't kill me if you tried.  
**Johnny**: You betrayed me! You're not good. You, you're just a chicken. Chip-chip-chip-chip-cheep-cheep.  

**Claudette**: Everything goes wrong all at once. Nobody wants to help me. And I'm dying.  
**Lisa**: You're not dying, mom.  
**Claudette**: I got the results of the test back - I definitely have breast cancer.
